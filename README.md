# ConnectTheDots

A repository to store and showcase dotfiles and desktop customizations from the KUOSC.

### About This Project

This repository is a community-driven collection of dotfiles and desktop rices from the Kathmandu University Open Source Community and contributors like you.

The goal is to create a central hub where we can:

- Share our unique and beautiful desktop setups.
- Inspire others with cool configurations and tools.
- Connect with others who share a passion for customization.

### The Gallery

Here's where we showcase everyone's hard work. Find a setup you like, check out their dotfiles, and get inspired!
